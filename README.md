# data-cleaning-practice (Customer Data)

**Project Overview**
- This repository contains my practice work on data cleaning using a sample dataset. The data was generated for learning purposes.
- This project focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing of customer datasets using Google sheets.
- The goal was to take messy raw data and convert it into a clean, structured dataset for analysis.
- I also created documentation to explain each cleaning step performed.

**Skills Used**
- Google Sheets
- Data Cleaning
- Handlling Missing Values
- Removing Duplicates
- Formatting Phone Numbers, Emails & Dates
- Basic Summary Tables

**Project Files**
- **data_cleaning_practice.xlsx ->** Contains multiple sheets
  
  - **Raw Customer Registration Data ->** Original dataset with errors (typos, duplicates, missing values).
  - **Cleaned Customer Registration Data ->** Cleaned version of the dataset after applying transformations.
  - **Documentation_1 ->** Step-bystep explaination of cleaning actions taken.
  - **Raw Customer Purchase Data ->** Original dataset with errors (typos, duplicates, missing values).
  - **Cleaned Customer Purchase Data ->** Cleaned version of the dataset after applying transformations.
  - **Documentation_2 ->** Step-bystep explaination of cleaning actions taken.

**Cleanign Actions Performed**
1. Removed duplicate customer entries
2. Fixed inconsistent formatting in names and addresses
3. Standardized phone number formats
4. Corrected invalid emails
5. Filled missing values in Age and Purchase columns
6. Converted text-based dates into proper date format
7. Created summary (total purchases, lowest & highest purchases, number of customers)
8. Created proper documentation for each cleaning step
